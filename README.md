- Expense Management: Add expenses to events and specify who paid for them and who participated in each expense.
- Participant Tracking: Easily assign expenses to participants and specify their contribution to each expense.
- Expense Visualization: View detailed breakdowns of expenses, including total expenses, individual contributions, and remaining balances.
- Settlements: Automatically calculate and display who owes money to whom based on the expenses incurred and payments made.
- Money Balances: Track money balances between participants, showing who owes money and who is owed money within each event.
